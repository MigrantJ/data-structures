###Use Cases
A doubly-linked list should be used instead of a standard linked list whenever
the data can be added or removed from either end. For example, if one were
modeling a series of lego blocks, with the desire to either put a new block on 
top, or put the entire stack on top of another block. Any model that needs to 
build elements "out from the middle", instead of from one end or another, is
an ideal use case.
